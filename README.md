# GW2 Meta Planner

Rough prototype built with alpine.js.

- Built around a CSS grid that represents a full daily reset cycle, with rows for 5 minute increments
- Data is managed in `data.json`, described by `schema.json`
- alpine.js used for "state management" and live updates (and localstorage)
