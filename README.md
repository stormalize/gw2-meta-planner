## Development

Minimal file watching for CSS, JS, PHP/HTML, and JSON inside the `src` directory:

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

For live browser refresh, can use the Live Server extension in VS Code.

### Build

In addition to processing content, this command will also copy CSS/JS assets to the `public` directory

```sh
npm run build

# or
php build.php --assets
```
